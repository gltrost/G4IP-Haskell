## G4IP-Haskell

### Introduction and Inspiration

This project is an implementation Roy Dyckhoffâ€™s contraction-free sequent calculus g4ip, which allows for a proof-search method for the constructive propositional sequent calculus. This project was inspired by a Standard-ML homework assignment at Carnegie Mellon, but has been rewritten in Haskell here.  

### Testing 

Tests can be added in `test/Spec.hs`. This project was built with stack, so to run tests, simply type `stack test` at the root directory.
